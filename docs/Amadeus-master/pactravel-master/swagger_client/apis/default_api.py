The search doesn't return a distinct set of price options, but rather, can tell you the price of flying from a given city to some destination, for a trip of a given duration, that falls within a given date range.</p>  <p>The search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available.

We try to keep this list as fresh as possible for you, but be aware that it may not always be exactly up-to-date and it can change without warning.</p>  <p>Despite this limitation don't underestimate the power of this API. Thanks to its quick response speed you can easily pair it with other APIs to provide a low fare and inspiration for any destination.

        Flight Inspiration Search - Go beyond the traditional search by origin, destination and dates to meet the needs of travelers looking for suggestions and a search experience that reflects the way they choose their trip. This can help you answer the question \"Where can I go within a given travel budget?\"
        <p>The Inspiration Flight Search allows you to find the prices of one-way and return flights from an origin city without necessarily having a destination, or even a flight date, in mind. The search doesn't return a distinct set of price options, but rather, can tell you the price of flying from a given city to some destination, for a trip of a given duration, that falls within a given date range.</p>  <p>The search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available. Here is <a href=\"https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/flight-search-cache-origin-destination.csv\">a list of the currently supported origin-destination IATA location pairs</a>. We try to keep this list as fresh as possible for you, but be aware that it may not always be exactly up-to-date and it can change without warning.</p>  <p>Despite this limitation don't underestimate the power of this API. Thanks to its quick response speed you can easily pair it with other APIs to provide a low fare and inspiration for any destination. For example, you can could combine it with a event search API and suggest a total price to see go and see an concert or a game in a selection of cities.</p> 
        This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
        asynchronous HTTP request, please define a `callback` function
        to be invoked when receiving the response.

            for asynchronous request. (optional)
        :param str apikey: API Key provided for your account, to identify you for API access. Make sure to keep this API key secret. (required)
        :param str origin: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code\">IATA code</a> of the city from which the traveler will depart. See the location and airport interfaces for more information. (required)
        :param str destination: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code\">IATA code</a> of the city to which the traveler is going
        :param str departure_date: Range of dates between which the traveler could depart. Dates are specified in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\">ISO 8601</a> yyyy-MM-dd date format. Ranges are inclusive and ranges of months will apply from the start to the end of the month. If just a single date is specified, only that date will be searched. By default, the date range starts today and applies up to 361 in the future is applied. Past dates are generally not supported, future dates should be in the next 361 days, although results start to become sparse after about 6 months in the future, as airlines may still be defining their schedules. The default is to search all future dates available.
        :param bool one_way: When set to true, the query will be for a single trip from the origin to the destination. When this parameter is not provided, or is set to false, the query is for a round trip from the origin to the destination and back again.
        :param str duration: The allowed duration or range of durations of the trip, in days. This parameter must not be set if the one-way parameter is set to true.
        :param bool direct: Limit the search to results that do not require the passenger to change plane?
        :param str max_price: Maximum price of trips to find in the result set, in the currency specified for this origin and destination pair in the cache contents spreadsheet. So, for example, if the origin is NYC, and the max price is 400, this means 400 USD. If the origin is PAR, and the max price is 400, this means 400 EUR. By default, no limit is applied
        :param str aggregation_mode: Specifies the granularity of results to be found. DESTINATION is the default and finds one result per city. COUNTRY finds one result per country, DAY finds on result for every day in the date range, WEEK finds one result for every week in the date range. Note that specifying a small granularity but a large search scope may result in a huge output. For some very large outputs, the API may refuse to provide a result.
