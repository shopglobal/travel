Travel helper using Amadeus api information to generate travel plans and Ideas for a user.

This application will bring up a login page. It will easily allow new users to sign up so go ahead and create a login (you can use fake emails and names if you want for right now)

For testing the functionality of this application please login and select either airport or train origin location. Then add your departure and return date as well as your max price you are willing to pay and click Travel. The travel optimizer will then generate a list of possible destinations that you could travel to on that date range and price. 

Please note that this data comes from amadeus api and if there is any data that exists/ doesn't exist then it's just data that we don't have.

Because of this you may find that many locations have few to no flights. Some recommendations for this is choose popular origin locations if you are testing the program such as New York, or Salt Lake. 

Also note that many of the train locations do contain cities outside the US.
